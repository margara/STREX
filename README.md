# STREX
STREX is a Stream Reasoning tool that combines temporal and ontological reasoning

STREX requires the T-Rex library (https://github.com/deib-polimi/TRex),
the RDFox library (https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/),
and ANTLR version 4.6.

To compile the project, simply run make. Make sure that the paths to T-Rex, RDFox,
and ANTLR headers and lib are correct.

To run the project, run ./STREX.

The executable will run performance measurements.
To customize the execution, refer to the parameters in the Common/Consts.h file.
